We conducted experiments using the following datasets.

- CamRest676_annotated.json: the new annotated dataset for generative ellipsis and co-reference resolution research for task-oriented dialogue.
  - We divided newly annotated `CamRest676_annotated.jsonl` from following paper into three parts (training, valid, test): 

"GECOR: An End-to-End Generative Ellipsis and Co-reference Resolution Model for Task-Oriented Dialogue" 
(Jun Quan, Deyi Xiong, Bonnie Webber and Changjian Hu. EMNLP, 2019)
